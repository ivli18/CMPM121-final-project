## Introducing the team

- **Engine Lead: Bryce**  
  Bryce is leading our technical architecture, researching engine options, and guiding how we structure our codebase. He’ll help the team get up to speed with whatever platform we choose and aim to shield us from unnecessary complexity.

- **Design Lead: Shawn**  
  Shawn is driving the creative vision — shaping the game’s look, feel, and player experience. He’ll be prototyping visual ideas and helping align our code and assets around a cohesive design language.

- **Tools & Testing Lead: Ivan**  
  Ivan is overseeing our development tooling (like Git, GitHub, and editor setup), ensuring smooth collaboration. He’ll also lead testing efforts — both automated checks and organizing playtests — to keep quality high.

Since we’re a small team, we’ll stay flexible: everyone will contribute ideas across domains and support each other wherever needed.
